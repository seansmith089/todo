TITLE  
Todo List

DESCRIPTION  
Todo list created with React and Firebase

WHY I CREATED THIS PROJECT  
I created this project to gain a better understanding of the CRUD process while using a cloud database.

WHAT I LEARNED  
Firebase: I gained a good grasp of the basic CRUD actions and was able to successfully implement them into this project

React Portals: In this project, I decided to implement the error modal using React portals as I had previously read that this is the best practice to avoid overlapping issues
